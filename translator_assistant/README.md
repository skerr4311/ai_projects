## Basic setup

First, let's set up the environment by executing the following code:

```cmd
python3.11 -m venv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate # activate my_env
```

Run the following commands in the terminal to receive the outline of the project, rename it with another name and finally move into that directory:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/translator-with-voice-and-watsonx
cd translator-with-voice-and-watsonx
```
