# AI Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of AI projects completed as part of my learning journey through Coursera, specifically for the IBM Certificate in AI Development. Each project explores different aspects of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing, with hands-on implementations and practical applications.

## Projects Overview

Below is a list of the main projects in this repository. Each project folder contains its own `README.md` file with detailed instructions and information.

---

### [conversation_bot](conversation_bot/README.md)

A simple chatbot built using Hugging Face's `transformers` library. This project demonstrates how to set up and run a conversational AI model, with guidance on choosing and using different large language models (LLMs) for various NLP tasks.

---

### [emotion_detector](emotion_detector/README.md)

A project focused on emotion detection from text. This was the final project for a Coursera module, applying NLP techniques to classify emotions in user input.

---

### [image_tagging](image_tagging/README.md)

An AI image tagging project using Python and Gradio. This project explores how to set up an environment for image captioning and tagging, leveraging libraries like `langchain`, `transformers`, and `torch`.

---

### [note_taker](note_taker/README.md)

A business AI meeting companion that uses speech-to-text (STT) technology. This project demonstrates how to transcribe audio from meetings and analyze the resulting text, with setup instructions for audio processing and transcription.

---

### [personal_data](personal_data/README.md)

A project that integrates IBM Watsonx language models and embeddings for custom document Q&A. It covers how to obtain IBM Cloud credentials, set up the environment, and connect a web frontend to a backend powered by LLMs for personalized data interaction.

---

### [translator_assistant/models](translator_assistant/models/README.md)

A collection of self-serve text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) models from IBM Watson. Includes Docker-based deployment instructions and links to detailed guides for each model:

- [Speech-to-Text (STT)](translator_assistant/models/stt/README.md): Run a local STT service using Docker.
- [Text-to-Speech (TTS)](translator_assistant/models/tts/README.md): Deploy a TTS service with Docker, supporting multiple languages and voices.

---

### [ui_chatbot](ui_chatbot/README.md)

A web-based chatbot UI built with Flask. This project demonstrates how to host a simple backend server and connect it to a frontend for interactive chatbot experiences.

---

### [voice_chatbot](voice_chatbot/README.md)

A voice-enabled chatbot application, including both speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities. The project provides Docker-based setup instructions and showcases how to build assistants for various roles (therapist, mechanic, storyteller, professor) using AI models.
