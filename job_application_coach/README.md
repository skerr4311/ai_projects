### Setting up a virtual environment
Let's create a virtual environment. Using a virtual environment allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately, avoiding conflicts between package versions.

In the terminal of your Cloud IDE, ensure that you are in the path /home/project, then run the following commands to create a Python virtual environment.

```
pip install virtualenv 
virtualenv my_env # create a virtual environment named my_env
source my_env/bin/activate # activate my_env
```

##### Installing necessary libraries
To ensure a seamless execution of our scripts, and considering that certain functions within these scripts rely on external libraries, it's essential to install some prerequisite libraries before we begin. For this project, the key libraries weâ€™ll need are Gradio for creating user-friendly web interfaces and IBM Watson Machine Learning for leveraging advanced LLM model.

Gradio package: Gradio allows us to build interactive web applications quickly, making our AI models accessible to users with ease.
IBM Watson Machine Learning package: IBM Watson Machine Learning package integrates powerful IBM LLM models into our project.
Here's how to install these packages (still from your terminal):
```
# installing necessary pacakges in my_env
python3.11 -m pip install gradio==5.12.0 
python3.11 -m pip install ibm_watsonx_ai==1.1.20
python3.11 -m pip install email-validator==2.1.1 
python3.11 -m pip install numpy==1.26.4 
python3.11 -m pip install pandas==2.1.4
```

Now, the environment is ready to create Python files.
